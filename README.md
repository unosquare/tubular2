*:star:Please star this project if you find it useful!*

New Tubular2 with Angular6 (Angular2) and Angular Material 2 featuring:

* Full Grid with sorting, filtering, exporting just like the previous Tubular 1 component.

**Important Notice** - Although Tubular 1 contains several inputs and form related-components, this new version will contain ONLY a grid component. Current implementations of Material2 and Angular6 have enough support for forms. We recommend using [Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms).

You can try [Plunker demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/iuy8LWcsbaUc4NAJpkvi?p=preview).

Developing with .NET as backend? check [Tubular DotNet](https://github.com/unosquare/tubular-dotnet) project.

If you are looking for Angular 1 support, please see [Tubular 1](https://github.com/unosquare/tubular)
