Tubular for Angular6 (formerly Tubular2) is a set of components based on [Angular Material 2](https://material.angular.io) featuring:

* Full Grid with sorting, filtering, exporting just like the previous Tubular for AngularJs component.

**Important Notice** - Although Tubular 1 contains several inputs and form related-components, this new version will contain ONLY a grid component. Current implementations of Material2 and Angular6 have enough support for forms. We recommend using [Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms).

You can try [Plunker demo](https://plnkr.co/edit/AcixVrMSN1dmUYeRik91?p=preview).
